# Project: HTML Forms [HTML/CSS]

## Description

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [HTML/CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css). The goal of the project is to rebuild the form used by [Mint.com](https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html) for user sign-ups. The purpose is to strengthen some of the skills learnt during the original foundation course and better understand user focused design.
